### <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Ruxit detects clustered apps and provides visibility into their transaction flows, from the user level to the database and code level. Ruxit also creates and adapts real-time dependency graphs of all your pushed apps and connected databases. If Ruxit detects an anomaly in your environment, it directs you to the root cause with these dependency graphs and the data it collects. 

The following list describes the key features of Ruxit:

* **AI Powered**: Ruxit Artificial Intelligence locates performance issues and pinpoints underlying root causes in real time.

* **Analytical**: Ruxit gives you operational insight and the ability to oversee and manage web-scale applications. 

* **Self learning**: Ruxit learns your environment and understands the complexity of your distributed applications.

* **Provides SaaS convenience with data on-prem**: Ruxit is available as a SaaS offering, but also as a managed solution on your own infrastructure.

See the Dynatrace website for more details on [Ruxit](http://www.dynatrace.com/en/ruxit).
